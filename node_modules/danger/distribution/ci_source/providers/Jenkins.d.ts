/**
 * ### CI Setup
 * Ah Jenkins, so many memories. So, if you're using Jenkins, you're hosting your own environment.
 *
 * ### GitHub
 * You will want to be using the
 * [GitHub pull request builder plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+pull+request+builder+plugin)
 * in order to ensure that you have the build environment set up for PR integration.
 *
 * With that set up, you can edit your job to add `yarn danger ci` at the build action.
 *
 * ### Pipeline
 * If you're using [pipelines](https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/) you should be using the
 * [GitHub branch source plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Branch+Source+Plugin) for easy setup and handling of PRs.
 *
 * After you've set up the plugin, add a `sh 'yarn danger ci'` line in your pipeline script and make sure that build PRs is enabled.
 *
 * ## Token Setup
 *
 * ### GitHub
 * As you own the machine, it's up to you to add the environment variable for the `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`.
